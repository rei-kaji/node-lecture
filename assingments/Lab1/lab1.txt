Node – Lab #1								     Jun 16, Mon

Objective: In this lab, we will start using the express.js framework on top of node.js, and we will build a guestbook application with it.
  
Note: Please read instructions carefully. You must submit your work by 5:00 pm. Submissions should be in the form of a  Github link or via codesandbox link.

Your task is to create a “guestbook” application. That is, you will build a website that has a “home” page, a “leave a note” page and a “read notes left by others” page (you can name those pages in any way you like). 

Your home page will greet visitors and provide links to the other pages. 
Your “leave a note” page will contain a form and a submit button.
Your “read notes left by others” page will display the notes left before in a list.
Your website also needs to have a “404-Not” Found page for any other requests coming from unrecognized routes. 

All your html pages should be in a “views” folder. 

In your routes module, you should send your html files as a response to the incoming requests.

Style all your pages using a single main.css file. Your stylesheet should be located in a “public” folder.

Save and upload all your work on Google Classroom to Week 1 > Lab 1 Submission.
